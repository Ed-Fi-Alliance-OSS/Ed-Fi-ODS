# Ed-Fi Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

The Ed-Fi Alliance community is made up of technology and education
professionals committed to using data to drive better student outcomes.

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in the
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of how you
identify yourself or how others perceive you. We pledge to act and interact in
ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy
community.

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces - virtual and in
person.

## Our Standards of Community Engagement

We strive to hold each other to high standards of community engagement and
collaboration. To do so, we encourage behavior that contributes to a positive
environment, such as:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility for and apologizing to those affected by our
  mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

We define harassment as any unwelcome conduct or behavior that creates a
hostile, intimidating, or offensive environment. Examples of unacceptable
behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without their explicit permission

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[governance@ed-fi.org](mailto:governance@ed-fi.org) or individually to any
member of the [Governance Advisory Team](https://www.ed-fi.org/community/). All
complaints will be handled with discretion and respect and will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and fairly.

All members of the Ed-Fi Alliance staff and community leaders are obligated to
respect the privacy and security of  any incident reported.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community governance leaders will follow these guidelines determining the
consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the
nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was
inappropriate. A public or private apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the
people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code
of Conduct, for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in
community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these
terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the
community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the
people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code
of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a
permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
